Drowning Knights is and was a personal passion project of mine. In 2023, I got very interested in Game development. I first started with developing small Java games (since that's my programming language of choice) and ended up duplicating a small Java game by following a Yotube tutorial. I even attempted to build my own Game Engine using. That was a shortlived dream as it was way too much effort to implement for very little reward. So i decided to take the coward's way out and learn to use a Game engine. 

The choice of game engines was a pretty straightforward one for me personally. The top 2 game engines at the time were Unreal and Unity Engine, with Godot a a close 3rd. Since I didn't know much about game development, my choice made itself after taking one look at unreal engine and realising that the programming sitting behind it is the dreaded C++. Only hellfire and brimstone would make me start using C++ so I decided to pick up C# and start my journey with Unity. 

It was a lot of fun an frustration learning to use Unity. After another couple of Youtube tutorials and recreating some games, I decided to take myself out of tutorial hell by developing my own original game. That's where Drowning Knight was born. The idea came to me in the shower, hence the water theme. And the knight was a consequence of free player sprites being hard to come by. After that, the final thing to work out were the game mechanics. This took me a couple of weeks. Who knew the hardest thing about developing a game were the game mechanics. Crazy right? That's basically the story of how Drowning Knights came to be. 

That's how Drowning Knight, my very first microgame came to be. I hope you enjoy it if you decide to check it out.
