Tiger Aesthetics, nestled in Sutton Coldfield, specializes in Eyelash Extension Training, Lash Extensions, Semi Permanent Make-up, and Eyebrow Treatments.

After thriving for over 5 years on word of mouth, Trixie, the dedicated owner, recognized the need for a digital presence to propel her business forward. A platform where clients could easily connect and explore the array of fantastic services offered.

In just 4 weeks, we transformed this vision into reality, crafting the Tiger Aesthetics website using the versatile static site generator, Hugo. Unlike traditional website builders, such as Squarespace or Webflow, this approach allowed us the freedom to implement tailored features while keeping costs minimal.

Among the enhancements, we incorporated convenient PDFs accessible via links, seamlessly integrated contact forms ensuring prompt email notifications for Trixie, and optimized the site for mobile devices, ensuring a stellar user experience across all screens.

Remarkably, this transformation came at no cost to Tiger Aesthetics, as we leveraged Netlify for hosting. Moreover, our expertise extended beyond mere website development, as we employed SEO and DNS strategies to enhance Tiger Aesthetics' visibility on Google, consequently boosting their rankings.
