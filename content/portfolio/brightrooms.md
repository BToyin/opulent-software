Brightrooms is a property management specialist based in Birmingham. With a focus on integrity, communication, and compassion, they add value to tenants, landlords, and investors by taking the hassle out of property management.

The project began when Jaffar, the mastermind behind Brightrooms, took a hard look at the company’s operational costs. He discovered that his simple, DIY Squarespace website was siphoning off nearly £30 a month. Given the low traffic to the site, this expense was not justifiable.

That's where we came in. Leveraging our expertise in cloud development, We firstly cloned the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then ditched Squarespace in favor of the cloud (AWS, to be exact). We switched to hosted the site statically on AWS S3 and transferred the domain to AWS Route53.  To top it off, we helped Jaffar set up shiny new business email addresses with his custom domain.

In just under two weeks, we wrapped up the cloning and migration process, slashing Brightrooms' monthly web expenses from £30 to under £1. Along the way, we even polished up the site—smoothing scrolling and re-arranging elements for a more user-friendly experience. Now, with its AWS hosting, the Brightrooms website’s costs are directly tied to its traffic, making it as scalable as it is stylish.
