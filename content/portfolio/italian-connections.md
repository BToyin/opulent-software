We don't all get it absolutely correct the first time round right? That was certainly the case with Harry. Despite the fact I was the one that designed the website, He had a fairly dramatic change of heart about what he wanted including the name of the business and accent colors for the website. And we're all allowed to change our minds, so that's what I helped Harry do... change his mind.

After a re-discovery call, and re-establishing the vision for this rebrand, we got to work on redesigning the website and transferring over the domain and taking the old website offline. A redesign with a couple of revisions was finished a couple of weeks later. The same features but a more modern and sleek look means that Harry is now very happy with the website.

Harry has even taken things further by employing our services once again to enable website tracking so that he can kick off a google ads campaign. We're all allowed to change our minds, and with opulent software, you can rest assured that we will work with you until we get it right (though we hope to do that the first time round of course.)
