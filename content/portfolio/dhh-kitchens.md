DHH Kitchens stands as a reputable local family-operated business specializing in kitchen transformations. Based in Sutton Coldfield, they specialize in installing top-tier bespoke kitchens at competitive rates. With an extensive 35+ years of collective experience, the timing was ripe for this dynamic father-son team to establish an online presence that truly reflects their brand ethos.

Upon reaching out to our team, an engaging discovery call ensued, followed by the provision of existing marketing materials and reference sites. From there, we embarked on the journey of creating a website that showcases their stellar craftsmanship while inviting potential clients to engage further.

Championing a vibrant palette with a bold pink accent color, our task demanded creativity to strike a balance between playfulness and professionalism. Within a swift 4-week timeframe, we brought their vision to life, delivering the DHH Kitchens website. Leveraging bespoke development and opting for Netlify hosting over conventional website builders, we ensured minimal operational costs at just Â£10 per year for the domain.

The website looks and feels fantastic but our solutions weren't limited to just aesthetics; we implemented practical features such as sticky footers and headers to streamline customer conversion contact forms for swift communication, and optimized the site for mobile responsiveness, ensuring an exceptional user experience across all devices. Moreover, our expertise extended to implementing SEO and DNS strategies, amplifying DHH Kitchens' online visibility and bolstering their search engine rankings on platforms like Google.
